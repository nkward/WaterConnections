# WaterConnections

Shiny App code for the interactive educational outreach tool: https://nkward.shinyapps.io/waterconnections/

This tool was developed as a part of dissertation research conducted by Nicole K. Ward (researcher ORCID: 0000-0001-7549-0153). 

The target audience of the educational tool is lakefront property owners. The goal of the tool is to conceptually connect today's decisions related to lawn fertilizer application and waterfront buffer installation/maintenace to future water quality outcomes. 

The effectiveness of this tool in changing landowner perspectives was tested in the Lake Sunapee Region of New Hampshire (USA) in summer 2020. The study manuscript is in prep for publication.
